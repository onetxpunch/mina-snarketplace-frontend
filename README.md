# 🧡 Astro + 🤍 Mina Starter Kit

![build](../../actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

Astro is a fast frontend framework designed around island architecture instead of single page apps which allows surgical updates to isolated sections of DOM code.

Mina is a ZkApp layer for developing decentralized applications! This template is an intersection of both projects, it provides a friendly jump off point for rapidly iterating on frontend application ideas.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
